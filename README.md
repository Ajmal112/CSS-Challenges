# CSS-Challenges Repository

Welcome to my CSS-Challenges repository! This repository is a collection of CSS challenges that I have created to improve my front-end development skills and explore different UI design concepts. Each challenge focuses on a specific aspect of CSS and web design.

## Challenges

I have set a goal to complete 30 CSS challenges, and I will be regularly adding new challenges as I progress. After reaching the initial goal, I plan to continue creating more challenges to further challenge myself and enhance my skills.

Feel free to explore the challenges, view the source code, and try them out yourself. I hope these challenges inspire you to improve your CSS skills and encourage you to participate in the front-end development community.

## How to Use

To try out a challenge, simply navigate to the challenge folder of your interest. Inside each challenge folder, you will find an `index.html` file, a `styles.css` file, and any additional assets needed. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the challenge in action.

## Feedback and Contributions

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community. If you have any ideas for new challenges or ways to improve existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
